# QueueImplementation

This is my implementation of the Queue data structure.

I have utilized an interface for my class implementation, and I have also included a program that runs in the console and allows the user to manipulate a Queue using all the associated functions.

Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors (class implements interface)
